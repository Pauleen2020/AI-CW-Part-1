1. Open GA_Spider.m file, click run at the top bar in matlab.

This will run the generations then an output screen will show (this will render and save each frame to a file for quick viewing if the user wishes). 

DO NOT RESIZE the window (will break due to the render size changing and we havn't handled it)

THE WINDOW WILL KEEP FOCUSING YOUR COMPUTER TO IT (annoying i know)

once 300/300 has been reached, close the window, and there will be a best_spider_gait.mp4 generated for user curiosity.

2. open NN_Spider.m and click the run button at the top of matlab.

ditto

once the saving of video is complete, there will be a best_spider_gait_NN.mp4 for viewing.

The graphs shown in the video are the actual graphs from the relevant functions that created that gait
